# MORFE2.0

This repo implements the method and examples from:
* A. Vizzaccaro, G. Gobat, A. Frangi, C. Touze'. Direct parametrisation of invariant manifolds for non-autonomous forced systems including superharmonic resonances (2023) 



To use this code:
- download the folder on your PC and unzip it
- open VSCode and go to 'file -> open folder -> MORFE2.0-main'
- if julia is installed on your PC and julia extensions are installed in VSCode the "MORFE2.0-main" should be automatically activated
- otherwise activate the "MORFE2.0-main" environment to make sure the correct packages versions are used during the computation
- run 'launch_script.jl' with the play button in VSCode
